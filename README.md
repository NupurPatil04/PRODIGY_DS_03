# PRODIGY_DS_03 - Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains **Task 03** of my Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The task focuses on building and evaluating a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Name:** Social_Network_Ads.csv  
- **Description:** Contains demographic and behavioral data such as age, balance, job type, and duration, used to predict outcomes.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling categorical and numerical features  
   - Feature scaling  
   - Train-test split  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Trained a Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Accuracy Score  

4. **Visualization**  
   - **Top 10 Feature Importances** plotted as a horizontal bar chart for interpretability

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy Score: *0.87*  
- Most important feature: `duration`

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Learned how Decision Trees work internally for classification problems  
- Understood the importance of feature importance analysis in model interpretability  
- Practiced end-to-end ML workflow in Python
